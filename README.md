# Project-ABG

This repository contains the scripts used in both Matlab and Python to perform the research for ABGO classification

## Introduction

Our team focused on the goal of classifying anthrophony, geophony, biophony, and other sounds (AGBO) into 4 distinct categories. These categories can be described, respectively, as the sounds made by humans, various weather conditions, and animals. Sounds that fall outside of these categories fall into the "other" category. Our features were png images of MEL spectrograms, each two seconds in length.
